    paragraphs: [
      "A public company CFO carries significant responsibility — NI 52-109 CEO/CFO certifications, MD&A sign-off, audit committee participation, investor relations support. Our fractional CFOs have held these responsibilities for multiple listed companies simultaneously and understand the full weight of the role.",
      "We embed directly into your leadership team — attending board calls, representing the company to auditors and regulators, and building the financial narrative that investors need to make decisions.",
      "Unlike a consultant who delivers a report and leaves, we're accountable to the same deadlines and outcomes as a full-time hire — at 20–30% of the annual cost.",

    title: "SEDAR+ & Regulatory Filing",
    paragraphs: [
      "SEDAR+ is unforgiving — late filings, errors, or missing documents can result in cease-trade orders that destroy market confidence overnight. We treat every filing with the precision it demands.",
      "We maintain your continuous disclosure calendar, prepare every required document, coordinate with auditors and legal counsel, and submit through SEDAR+ on your behalf — on time, every time.",

      "Board members and institutional investors expect the same quality of reporting they see at large-cap issuers. We deliver it — using Power BI to build live, interactive dashboards that replace your manual quarterly Excel scramble.",
      "Every metric your board cares about — revenue, EBITDA, cash runway, KPI trends, segment performance — updated in real time and packaged into a polished PDF for the board pack.",

    paragraphs: [
      "Most small public companies are stuck on legacy desktop accounting platforms that create audit risk, prevent real-time reporting, and consume hours of manual work. We migrate you to a modern cloud platform with zero data loss and zero downtime.",
      "Our 5-phase methodology — audit, extract, configure, parallel-run, cutover — has migrated TSX-V, CSE, and NEO companies without a single business interruption.",
